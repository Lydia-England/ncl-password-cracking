# NCL Tools and Resources
The [National Cyber League (NCL)](https://nationalcyberleague.org/) is a bi-annual, virtual, puzzle-based, capture-the-flag style cybersecurity competition for high school and undergraduate students. 

*From the [NCL About Page](https://nationalcyberleague.org/about):* "NCL offers a fun way to learn and apply your skills in a safe environment - but it’s so much more than that, because with their NCL Scouting Reports you can present credible proof to employers of your hands-on expertise."
An article from the Applied Cybersecurity Division at NIST describes the [National Cyber League NICE Framework Success Story](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/nice-framework-resource-center/nice-framework-success-story-national).  

Information on upcoming NCL Competitions can be found [here](https://nationalcyberleague.org/competition).
