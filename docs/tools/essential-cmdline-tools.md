## Exif

## xxd
Usage:
```bash
xxd [options] [infile [outfile]]
```
or:
```bash
xxd -r [-s [-]offset] [-c cols] [-ps] [infile [outfile]]
```

Is the output of `xxd` too long/narrow?
You can change the number of columns in the output with the `-c` flag. 
For example, use `xxd` and output 32 columns with the following:
```bash
xxd -c 32 filename
```
The default number of columns is 16. 
(This may visually appear to be 8 columns. 
That's becaue it's counted in *octets*).
