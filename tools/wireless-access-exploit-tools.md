## Aircrack-ng Suite

### Aircrack-ng
[Aircrack-ng](https://aircrack-ng.org/documentation.html) is an 802.11 WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK key cracking program.
- Usage:
  ```bash
  aircrack-ng [options] <capture file(s)>
  ```
- Common options
    - `-n` to specify key length in WEP cracking.
- Static WEP cracking options
- WEP and WPA-PSK cracking options
    - `-w` (param: words) : Path to a wordlist or "-" without the quotes for stdin. Separate multiple wordlists by comma.
- WPA-PSK options
- SIMD selection
- Other options


### Aireplay-ng
[Airplay-ng](https://aircrack-ng.com/doku.php?id=aireplay-ng) is part of the Aircrack-ng Suite; it is used to inject frames.
Its primary function is to generate traffic for the later use in aircrack-ng for cracking the WEP and WPA-PSK keys.
- Attacks Implemented:
    - Attack 0: [Deauthentication](https://aircrack-ng.com/doku.php?id=deauthentication) (flag: `-0`)
    - Other attack types (1-9) listed on [Airplay-ng documentation website](https://aircrack-ng.com/doku.php?id=aireplay-ng).
- Usage: 
  ```bash
  aireplay-ng <options> <replay interface>
  ```
- Filter Options:
    - `-b bssid` : MAC address, Access Point
    - `-d dmac` : MAC address, Destination
    - `-s smac` : MAC address, Source
    - additional options in documentation.
- Replay Options:
    - `-x nbpps` : number of packets per second
    - `-p fctrl` : set frame control word (hex)
    - `-a bssid` : set Access Point MAC address
    - `-c dmac` : set Destination MAC address
    - `-h smac` : set Source MAC address
    - additional options in documentation.

### Aerodump-ng
[Airodump-ng](https://aircrack-ng.com/doku.php?id=airodump-ng) is used for packet capture, capturing raw 802.11 frames. 
- Options in documentation.
- Filter options
    - `--encrypt <suite>` : Filter APs by cipher suite
    - `--netmask <netmask>` : Filter APs by mask
    - `--bssid <bssid>` : Filter APs by BSSID
    - `--essid <essid>` : Filter APs by ESSID
    - `--essid-regex <regex>` : Filter APs by ESSID using a regular expression
    - `-a` : Filter unassociated clients
    - additional filter options in documentation.
